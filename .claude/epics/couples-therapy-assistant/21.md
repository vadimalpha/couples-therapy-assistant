# Task: UI/UX Mockups & Design System

## Description

Create comprehensive UI/UX mockups for all key screens and user flows of the Couples Therapy Assistant. Establish a design system with color palette, typography, and component patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design system established:
  - Color palette (calming, professional, gender-neutral)
  - Typography scale (headings, body, captions)
  - Spacing system (8px grid)
  - Component library (buttons, cards, forms, alerts)
- [ ] Authentication flow mockups:
  - Login page
  - Registration page
  - Password reset page
  - Partner invitation acceptance page
- [ ] Onboarding mockups:
  - Intake survey (multi-step form with progress indicator)
  - Partner invite flow
  - Welcome/dashboard first-time experience
- [ ] Conflict workflow mockups:
  - Conflict creation form (Partner A)
  - Conflict response form (Partner B - blind input)
  - Conflict dashboard (pending/completed lists)
  - Conflict detail page (before Partner B responds)
  - Conflict detail page (after both responded)
- [ ] Guidance display mockups:
  - Individual-Only Guidance card (Phase 1)
  - Joint-Context Personal Guidance card (Phase 2)
  - Relationship Guidance card (Phase 3)
  - Structured mode layout (JSON sections formatted)
  - Conversational mode layout (flowing text)
  - Pattern recognition alerts
  - Loading states while AI processes
- [ ] Safety & trust mockups:
  - Crisis resource footer design
  - "Report this advice" button placement
  - Terms of Service page layout
  - Privacy Policy page layout
  - Disclaimer banner
- [ ] Mobile responsive designs:
  - Mobile (320px-767px)
  - Tablet (768px-1023px)
  - Desktop (1024px+)

## Technical Details

**Design Tools**:
- Primary: Figma (collaborative, free tier)
- Alternative: Frame0 (if quick prototyping needed)

**Color Palette Recommendations**:
```
Primary: Calm blue (#4A90A4) - Trust, stability
Secondary: Warm coral (#E8A87C) - Empathy, warmth
Accent: Soft purple (#8B7EC8) - Wisdom, guidance
Success: Muted green (#7CB08A) - Growth, progress
Warning: Amber (#D4A84B) - Attention, caution
Error: Soft red (#C85C5C) - Crisis, urgency
Neutral: Gray scale (#F5F5F5 to #2D2D2D)
Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) - Soft, not clinical
```

**Typography**:
```
Headings: Inter or Nunito Sans (friendly, readable)
Body: Inter or Open Sans (clean, accessible)
Scale: 12px, 14px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px
```

**Key User Flows to Mockup**:

1. **Partner A Creates Conflict**:
   ```
   Dashboard → New Conflict → Fill Form → Submit →
   See Individual Guidance → Wait for Partner B
   ```

2. **Partner B Responds (Blind Input)**:
   ```
   Dashboard (notification) → View Conflict (title only) →
   Enter Response → Submit → See All Guidance + Partner A's Description
   ```

3. **Intake Survey Flow**:
   ```
   Welcome → Question 1-5 (Personal) → Question 6-10 (Relationship) →
   Question 11-15 (Conflict Style) → Question 16-18 (Goals) → Complete
   ```

**Component Patterns**:

1. **Guidance Card**:
   - Header with icon + title
   - Collapsible sections
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Action buttons (Report, Share, Save)

2. **Conflict List Item**:
   - Title + date
   - Status badge (Pending Response, Complete)
   - Partner indicator
   - Quick action (View, Archive)

3. **Form Inputs**:
   - Clear labels with optional hints
   - Validation states (error, success)
   - Character count for descriptions
   - Privacy toggle with explanation

4. **Crisis Footer**:
   - Always visible but not intrusive
   - Expandable for more resources
   - Accessible contrast ratios

**Emotional Design Considerations**:
- Avoid clinical/sterile appearance
- Use rounded corners (soft, approachable)
- Generous whitespace (reduce overwhelm)
- Supportive microcopy (encouraging, non-judgmental)
- Progress indicators (sense of accomplishment)
- Gentle color transitions (not jarring)
