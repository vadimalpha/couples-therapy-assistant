# Task: AI Pairing Engine

## Description
Develop the core AI-powered wine pairing engine that combines OpenAI GPT-4 capabilities with sophisticated algorithm development to provide intelligent wine recommendations. This system will parse recipe text, implement a preference weighting system based on user profiles, and create recommendation ranking logic that considers multiple factors including food characteristics, wine properties, user preferences, and contextual factors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- OpenAI GPT-4 API successfully integrated with proper error handling and rate limiting
- Pairing algorithm generates relevant wine recommendations with confidence scores
- Recipe text parser accurately extracts ingredients, cooking methods, and flavor profiles
- Preference weighting system incorporates user taste preferences and dietary restrictions
- Recommendation ranking logic provides consistently ordered results based on multiple scoring factors

## Technical Details
The pairing engine will be architected as a multi-layered system combining rule-based logic with AI-powered analysis. The OpenAI integration will handle natural language processing of food descriptions and generate initial pairing suggestions. The algorithm layer will apply business rules, user preferences, and contextual factors to refine recommendations. The recipe parser will use NLP techniques to extract structured data from unstructured recipe text, while the ranking system will implement a weighted scoring model that balances AI confidence with user preferences and wine availability.

## Dependencies
- Task 002 (Wine Database & API) for wine data access
- Task 003 (User Management System) for user preference data
- OpenAI API account and proper usage limits configuration
- Wine knowledge base and pairing rules database

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40
