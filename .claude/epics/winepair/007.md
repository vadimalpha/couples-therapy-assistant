# Task: User Experience & Onboarding

## Description
Implement the core user experience features including onboarding flow, camera integration, recipe input interface, and recommendation display. This task focuses on creating an intuitive and engaging user interface that guides users through the wine pairing process from initial setup to receiving recommendations.

The onboarding quiz will collect user preferences and dietary restrictions through 7-10 carefully crafted questions. Camera integration will allow users to capture photos of their dishes or ingredients for AI analysis. The recipe input interface will provide multiple ways for users to specify their meals, and the recommendation cards will display wine suggestions in an appealing, informative format.
