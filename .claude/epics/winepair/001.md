# Task: Infrastructure & Backend Setup

## Description
Set up the foundational infrastructure and backend services for the WinePair application. This includes AWS cloud infrastructure provisioning, Node.js/Express API scaffolding, PostgreSQL database schema design, Redis caching configuration, and CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions. This task establishes the core platform that all other services will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AWS infrastructure is provisioned and configured (Lambda, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
- Node.js/Express API framework is scaffolded with proper project structure
- PostgreSQL database is set up with initial schema and migrations
- Redis cache is configured and integrated
- CI/CD pipeline is implemented with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Technical Details
Implementation will use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK or Terraform for reproducible deployments. The Node.js API will follow RESTful conventions with proper middleware for logging, error handling, and security. PostgreSQL will be configured with connection pooling and backup strategies. Redis will be set up for session management and API response caching. GitHub Actions will handle automated testing, building, and deployment to staging/production environments.

## Dependencies
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- GitHub repository access for Actions setup
- Domain configuration for API endpoints

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40
- Parallel: true
