# Task: Wine Data Integration

## Description
Establish comprehensive wine data integration system through partnerships with wine databases like Vivino or Wine-Searcher. This includes setting up API integrations, implementing a robust data caching layer, designing wine database schema for optimal storage and retrieval, building search and filter capabilities, and creating a data normalization service to ensure consistent wine information across different data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Wine API partnership is established with at least one major provider (Vivino/Wine-Searcher)
- Data caching layer efficiently stores and retrieves wine information with appropriate TTL settings
- Wine database schema supports complex wine attributes, ratings, reviews, and pricing data
- Search and filter capabilities enable users to find wines by region, variety, price, rating, and other attributes
- Data normalization service standardizes wine information from multiple sources into consistent format

## Technical Details
Implementation will integrate with wine database APIs using proper authentication and rate limiting. Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed wine data with intelligent cache invalidation. PostgreSQL schema will include proper indexing for fast search operations on wine attributes. Search functionality will support full-text search with faceted filtering. Data normalization will handle variations in wine naming, vintage formats, and classification systems.

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure setup from Task 001 must be completed
- Wine API provider partnerships and API access credentials
- Data processing pipeline for initial wine data import

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: true
