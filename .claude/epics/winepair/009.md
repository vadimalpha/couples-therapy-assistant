# Task: Testing & App Store Deployment

## Description
Comprehensive testing, optimization, and deployment preparation for the WinePair application. This final task ensures the app meets quality standards, performs well across different devices, and successfully passes app store review processes. Includes implementing automated testing suites, performance optimization, creating app store assets, and managing the submission and review process.

This task cannot be parallelized as it requires all previous development tasks to be completed. It serves as the final quality gate before the app reaches end users through official app stores.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complete unit and integration test suite with >90% code coverage
- End-to-end UI testing using Detox covering critical user flows
- Performance optimization achieving target load times and smooth animations
- App store assets including screenshots, descriptions, and metadata prepared
- Successful submission and approval through Apple App Store and Google Play Store review processes

## Technical Details
- Jest and React Native Testing Library for unit tests
- Detox framework for E2E testing on iOS and Android
- Performance profiling using React Native performance tools
- App store asset creation following platform guidelines
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- App store submission workflows and review response procedures
