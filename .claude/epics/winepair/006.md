# Task: React Native Mobile Foundation

## Description
Establish the foundational React Native mobile application architecture for iOS, setting up the core project structure, navigation system, state management, and essential infrastructure components. This foundation will provide a scalable base for implementing wine pairing features, including proper API client configuration, reusable UI components, and development tooling setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- React Native project successfully created and configured for iOS development
- Navigation structure implemented with proper screen routing and deep linking support
- State management system (Redux or Context API) configured with proper data flow patterns
- API client configured with authentication, error handling, and request/response interceptors
- Basic UI components library created with consistent styling and theming

## Technical Details
The mobile foundation will be built using the latest React Native CLI setup with TypeScript support for better code quality and development experience. Navigation will utilize React Navigation v6 with stack and tab navigators configured for the app's main user flows. State management will be implemented using Redux Toolkit for complex state scenarios and React Context for simpler component-level state. The API client will be built with Axios, including proper interceptors for authentication token management and error handling. The UI component library will establish design system patterns with consistent spacing, colors, and typography.

## Dependencies
- iOS development environment setup (Xcode, simulators)
- React Native CLI and development tools
- Design system specifications and assets
