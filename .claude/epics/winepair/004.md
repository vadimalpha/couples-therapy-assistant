# Task: AI Image Processing Pipeline

## Description
Implement a comprehensive AI-powered image processing pipeline that can analyze food images and extract meaningful information for wine pairing recommendations. This includes integrating Google Vision API for general image recognition, developing a specialized food recognition service, implementing OCR capabilities for menu text extraction, and creating robust image preprocessing workflows with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Google Vision API successfully integrated and configured
- Food recognition service accurately identifies food items from images with >85% confidence
- OCR implementation successfully extracts text from menu images with proper formatting
- Image preprocessing pipeline handles various image formats and sizes
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms implemented for API failures

## Technical Details
The implementation will involve creating a modular image processing service that leverages Google Vision API for core computer vision capabilities. The food recognition component will be built on top of this foundation, potentially using custom models or enhanced prompting for better food-specific recognition. OCR functionality will handle menu text extraction with proper text cleaning and formatting. Image preprocessing will include resizing, format conversion, and quality enhancement to optimize API calls and improve recognition accuracy.

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (Backend API Foundation) must be completed for API integration
- Google Vision API account and credentials setup
- Image storage and processing infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 32
- Parallel: true
