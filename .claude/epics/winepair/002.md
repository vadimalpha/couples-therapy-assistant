# Task: Authentication & User Profile Service

## Description
Implement comprehensive user authentication and profile management system for the WinePair application. This includes OAuth 2.0 integration with popular providers, user registration and login workflows, profile management APIs, preference storage schema design, and JWT token management for secure session handling. The service will manage user identity, preferences, and personalization data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- OAuth 2.0 authentication is implemented with multiple providers (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- User registration and login workflows are functional with proper validation
- Profile management API allows users to update personal information and wine preferences
- Preference storage schema supports complex user taste profiles and dietary restrictions
- JWT token management provides secure authentication with proper refresh token handling

## Technical Details
Implementation will use established OAuth 2.0 libraries with support for multiple providers. User profiles will be stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing for quick lookups. JWT tokens will be implemented with short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens. Password hashing will use bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds. API endpoints will include proper input validation and sanitization.

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure setup from Task 001 must be completed
- OAuth provider registrations and API keys
- Email service configuration for account verification
